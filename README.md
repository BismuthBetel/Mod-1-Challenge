# Code Refactor Starter Code

# Horiseon Web Site

## Purpose

This website is used to generate leads for the consulting firm. I refactored the website so that it was more accessible and streamlined with expressive container elements, a web page title to see on the tab on the browser and in HTML, alternative text for images and consolidated CSS rules.
